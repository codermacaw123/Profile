                    The word "pad" means "fried" and "thai" means "of Thailand." Pad Thai is believed to have originated in the early 20th century, when it was created as a way to use up leftover rice noodles. The dish quickly became popular, and it is now one of the most well-known Thai dishes in the world.

                <br >
                
                <p > Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that is made with spaghetti, eggs, Parmesan cheese, and guanciale (cured pork jowl). It is a simple dish, but it is incredibly flavorful and satisfying.
            
                    The origins of carbonara are a bit murky, but it is thought to have originated in Rome in the early 20th century. The dish was originally made with guanciale, but it is now more commonly made with pancetta or bacon. The eggs and cheese are added to the pasta just before it is served, and the dish is tossed until it is creamy and delicious.

                    Carbonara is a very versatile dish, and it can be customized to your liking. For example, you can add different types of meat or seafood, or you can add different vegetables. You can also adjust the amount of salt and pepper to your taste.

                <p> Shibas are cute!!!</p>
                <p> An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country. Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already the most popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. They're sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.</p>

                <hr>
                <p> Watchful, aloof, imposing, and intimidating: The ancient Tibetan Mastiff is the guardian dog supreme. These densely coated giants are mellow and calm around the house, sweetly devoted to family, and aloof and territorial with strangers. Coming face to face with this ancient behemoth, an intruder up to no good will likely move on to easier pickings. TMs can stand 26 inches at the shoulder and weigh well over 100 pounds. It's impossible to discuss this breed without leaning on words like 'powerful,'¬ù 'muscular,'¬ù massive,'¬ù and 'substantial.'¬ù And yet, TMs are quite light-footed and will meet a perceived threat with surprising agility. The broad head, with its high-set, V-shaped ears and expressive brown eyes, projects a noble, sagacious expression.</p>

                <hr>
                <br>
                <p> The smallest of the AKC's retrievers, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is intelligent, affectionate, and eager to please. Play fetch with a tireless Toller until your right arm falls off, and he will ask you to throw left-handed. The little gundog with the big name is the smallest AKC retriever, standing ideally 18 or 19 inches at the shoulder. The Toller's trademark is a coat of stunning crimson, ranging from golden red to a dark coppery color, with white markings. Strong and agile, Tollers are medium dogs: medium in size, bone, and coat length. The almond-shaped eyes project an alert expression. Tollers are upbeat athletes who require outlets for their boundless vigor: hunting, hiking, camping, and, of course, swimming (for which they are ideally suited, down to their webbed feet). Tollers are smart, handsome, affectionate companions, but these red tornadoes can be recommended only to those with enough time and energy to keep them usefully occupied.</p>

                <p> Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio with drummer Tr√© Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called Sweet Children, and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.</p>

                <p> The Koenigsegg Jesko is a limited-edition hypercar that was introduced in 2019. It is powered by a 5.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine that produces 1,600 horsepower and 1,100 pound-feet of torque. The Jesko can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.6 seconds and has a top speed of 330 mph.

                    The Jesko features a number of advanced technologies, including active aerodynamics, a carbon fiber monocoque chassis, and a lightweight body. The car also has a number of comfort and convenience features, such as a leather interior, a panoramic sunroof, and a sound system.
                    
                    The Jesko is one of the fastest and most technologically advanced cars in the world. It is a limited-edition car, so only a few hundred will ever be built. The Jesko starts at $2.8 million.</p>
